# CoreOS Buildroot Addons

## About

Buildroot is an SDK for building embedded Linux distributions.  It handles the
removal of man pages, shared files, and many pieces not germaine to running
on an embedded platform.  At CoreOS we use Buildroot for the generation of 
[minimal containers](https://github.com/brianredbeard/minimal_containers) for
use with [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt) and Docker.
